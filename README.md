This project taught me how to work with an imbalanced dataset and the basics of data analytics.

In this project I learned how to fix null values using various data augmentation techniques and how to compensate for shortage or unnecessary surplus of data along with which i also learnt to deal with extraneous data

I also gained insights on how to appropriately represent the data visually in various formats such as heatmaps and bar graphs etc.

Give the notebook a test run and hope you dont crash ✈️✈️
